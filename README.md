The main code integrates ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) with an microcontroller board that invlove with Teensy board to control a robot's motors based on incoming velocity commands. 
This code enables an Teensy board to receive Twist messages from a ROS 2 network to control motor movements and an LED. 
It uses the micro-ROS library for ROS 2 integration, sets up the necessary subscriptions, and defines callbacks to handle motor commands based on the received velocity data.
